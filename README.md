# Titanic_classifier

## Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python. The dataset used provides information about passengers who were aboard the RMS Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- `Survived`: Survival status of the passenger (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived).
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = First class, 2 = Second class, 3 = Third class).
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- `Fare`: Fare paid by the passenger.
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and tools.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.

## Project Structure

- `Titanic.py`: The main Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Titani_test.py`: Directory containing scripts or notebooks for testing and validating the model.

## Results

After running the script, the model's accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are printed for both the training and test sets.

## Next Steps

- Fine-tune the model by experimenting with hyperparameter tuning and trying different machine learning algorithms.
- Explore feature engineering techniques to potentially improve model performance.
- Consider handling imbalanced classes if necessary.
- Implement cross-validation for a better estimate of the model's performance.
